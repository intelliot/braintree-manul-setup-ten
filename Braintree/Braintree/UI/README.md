# Braintree Payments UI for iOS

Braintree-Payments-UI is an iOS library that enables you to create a simple, native feeling UI for collecting payment information, including credit card details and PayPal accounts.

This library is comprised of dumb views and controls without much logic or ability to communicate with a payments processor. We compose these in our ideal Drop In payments experience in Drop In.
